# Telstra Cybersecurity Virtual Experience Program

This repository documents my completion of the **Telstra Cybersecurity Virtual Internship** offered through [Forage](https://www.theforage.com).

## Project Overview

In this virtual simulation, I assumed the role of a cybersecurity analyst at Telstra and responded to a simulated malware attack targeting a vulnerable HTTP endpoint (`/tomcatwar.jsp`) using the Spring4Shell (CVE-2022-22965) exploit.

## Key Tasks Completed

- Developed a custom firewall script in Python to detect and block suspicious HTTP POST traffic.
- Implemented filters against malicious headers (`suffix`, `c1`, `c2`) and payload patterns in request bodies.
- Analyzed simulated attack traffic using a test script.
- Authored a professional postmortem report outlining the attack timeline, root cause, response, and lessons learned.

## Skills Gained

- Network security fundamentals  
- Python scripting for incident response  
- Log analysis and HTTP request filtering  
- Writing post-incident documentation
